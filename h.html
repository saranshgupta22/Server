    <h1>Just one way</h1>

    <p class="center">I am a newbie at blogging but have many tales to tell from my various trips, for me, I want to inspire people to come out of their routines, schedules & day to day life & explore small beauties of life on any budget that suits their pockets. My idea of travel is to move away from the confines of my home & to adapt to the landscape, people, food, language, culture & history.   Travelling made me find myself as a more patient & mindful person. With every trip, I grew & added a new facet to my personality.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="jowt-logo-website.png" class="centre">
    <p class="center">I strongly feel about sustainable travel & implement all that I learn on each of my journeys as I strongly believe change needs to start from me. In a small country, I learned to respect the pedestrians as they are vulnerable when on the road & many more life lessons.</p>
